The COVID-19 vaccine benefit-risk assessment tool facilitates the quantification of the benefits and the risks associated with various vaccines.

<div class="expandablecontent" id = 'tab1'>
  The tool can be used to model the benefits (prevented cases, hospitalizations, icu admissions and deaths) and risks of various COVID-19 vaccines. <br> 
  
  
  By uploading the required data sets the user can chose to model the benefits for:
  <ul>
    <li>a set of European countries</li>
    <li>a set of age categories</li>
    <li>a range of vaccines</li>
    <li>a number of variants of concern</li>
  </ul>
  Benefits are computed independent of sex and a maximum of 3 vaccine doses are allowed. <br><br>
  By uploading the required data sets the user can chose to model the risks for:
  <ul>
    <li>a set of European countries</li>
    <li>males and females separately</li>
    <li>a range of vaccines</li>
    <li>a list of conditions which can differ per vaccine</li>
    <li>a set of age categories which differ per condition</li>
    <li>the background risk rate to compare the results to</li>
  </ul>

  Running the tool requires the following information:
  
  <ul>
    <li>For each country and age group included in the benefits analysis:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Number of inhabitants</li>
      <li>Proportion of this age group in the total COVID-19 burden for cases, hospitalizations, icu admission and mortality</li>
    </ul>
    <li>For each country and date included in the benefits analysis:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Number of COVID-19 cases, hospital admissions, icu admissions and deaths</li>
    </ul>
    <li>For each country, date and variant of concern included in the benefits analysis:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Proportion of the COVID-19 infections with this variant</li>
    </ul>
    <li>For each country, date, age group and vaccine included in the benefit analysis:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Number of first, second and third doses administred</li>
    </ul>
    <li>For each age group, sex, condition and vaccine included in the risk analysis:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Number of observed risk cases aggregated over the whole study period</li>
    </ul>
    <li>For each age group, sex and condition included in the risk analysis:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Number of observed risk cases not induced by vaccination</li>
      <li>Number of observed person years</li>
    </ul>
    Various data sources and observation periods can be included in the data.
    <li>For each age group, sex and vaccine in the risk analysis:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>The number of administred vaccines over the whole study period</li>
    </ul>
    When this number is imputed also the uncertainty of this imputation is required.
  </ul>
